# Contracts for Chapter 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

This directory is typically used to store API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas) for features that involve API development.

For "Chapter 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)", the primary output is educational content in MDX format. As such, there are no traditional API contracts generated as part of this implementation plan.

This directory is maintained for consistency with the project's standard planning structure.
