# Quickstart

This guide provides instructions on how to set up and run the Docusaurus project locally.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

3.  **Build the project**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static content hosting service.
