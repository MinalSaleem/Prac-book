## Prompt

Based on the constitution, create a detailed Specification for the Physical Al book. Include:
1. Book structure with 1 chapters and 3 lessons each (titles and descriptions)
2. Content guidelines and lesson format
3. Docusaurus-specific requirements for organization

## Response snapshot

I have created the specification document as requested. It includes the book structure, content guidelines, and Docusaurus-specific requirements. The specification is located at `specs/physical-ai-book/spec.md`.

## Outcome
